Intelligence starter

What you have
A minimal Next.js site with a landing page and a center input. It is production ready and deploys on Vercel.

How to deploy in about five minutes
1. Create a free account at vercel.com and sign in
2. Create a new project and pick Import Git Repository
3. Create a new empty GitHub repo on your account, then upload these files to the repo
4. Back on Vercel, select that repo and press Deploy
5. You will get a live URL within a minute

Optional custom domain
Buy a domain on Cloudflare or Namecheap. In Vercel, go to your project, then Settings, then Domains, and follow the steps there.

Next steps
This starter is built with the app directory. We can grow it into auth, a dashboard, and an owner console with the same structure.
